# Essentials

A personal **cybersecurity and technical reference archive**.  
This is where I keep configuration files, scripts, research notes, and other essential materials that I need quick access to from anywhere.  

This is not a teaching resource. It is a **personal, version-controlled vault** for technical operations, pentesting workflows, and sysadmin setups.

## Purpose

- Maintain a **centralized archive** of essential tools, references, and configurations.
- Provide **anywhere-access** without relying on a personal machine.
- Keep **tested, trusted, and personally verified** resources ready for deployment.
- Serve as a **long-term memory** for commands, exploits, configs, and techniques.

> Some material may be adapted or copied from external sources for personal learning and reference.  
> This repository is **not** an original works showcase; it’s a practical memory aid.

## Usage

This repository is **for my reference**. You are free to explore, but expect minimal documentation.  
Some files may appear outdated or highly specific to certain systems, but they remain valuable for quick recall.
